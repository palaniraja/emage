# DEFERRED 

I had this idea of mining images for deep-learning using search engines. But could not able to work on it, but I recently, found [idt](https://github.com/deliton/idt) project which does most of the same thing as I envisioned. 

The only thing missing was a web UI to manually filter/crop the images from the selection/downloaded with `vim` like key bidings to process largeset of images quickly.
